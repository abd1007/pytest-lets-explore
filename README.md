About

Welcome to "let's explore pytest", which includes several pytest
examples. pytest is a testing framework that can be used to test Python code,
amongst other things, and lives at www.pytest.org. Python 3 is used exclusively
in this repository, though pytest can test Python 2 software.

Environment

A conda environment file is provided, which all examples assume you are
using. <!> These examples assume you are familiar with your shell or
commandline, and are able to set up your environment appropriately.
